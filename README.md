# Accessible Website Tutorial

Welcome to The Accessability Tutorial Website Template! This website template is designed to help you create your own online resume website building off accessability learned from the associated Figma Web Design Tutorial.

## Getting Started

If you haven't done so already start with the visual design for your personal website by reviewing and editing the Figma template:

Once you feel ready to start coding your design start by reviewing the Wiki page. Because this website is designed for absolute beginners I have built extensive documentation which will help you go through the process.
